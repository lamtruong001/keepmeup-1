                       <h4>ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h4>
                     <p>By using the services, you are agreeing, on behalf of yourself and those you represent, to comply with and be legally bound by these terms as well as our privacy policy and all applicable laws. If you, for yourself or on behalf of those you represent, do not agree to any provision of these terms, you must, for yourself and on behalf any such person(s), discontinue the registration process, discontinue your use of the services, and, if you are already registered, cancel your account.</p>

                     <p>BASICALLY,</p>
                     <p>By using KeepMeUp, you agree to all the terms below.</p>

                     <h4>MODIFICATION OF TERMS</h4>
                     <p>KeepMeUp reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace the terms at any time. If the alterations constitute a material change to the terms, KeepMeUp will notify you by posting an announcement on the site. What constitutes a material change will be determined at KeepMeUp’s sole discretion. You shall be responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications. Using any Service or viewing any Visual Content shall constitute your acceptance of the Terms as modified.</p>

                     <p>In addition, when using particular features of the Services, you shall be subject to any posted guidelines or rules applicable to such Services.</p>

                     <p>Your access to and use of the Site and our Services may be interrupted from time to time as a result of equipment malfunction, updating, maintenance or repair of the Site or any other reason within or outside the control of KeepMeUp. KeepMeUp reserves the right to suspend or discontinue the availability of the Site and/or any Service and/or remove any Visual Content at any time at its sole discretion and without prior notice. KeepMeUp may also impose limits on certain features and Services or restrict your access to parts of or all of the Site and the Services without notice or liability.

                     <p>BASICALLY,</p>
                     <p>If these terms change, we will notify you. As well, at times things can go wrong and the service may be interrupted. It’s unlikely, but sometimes things can go really wrong.</p>

                     <h4>REGISTRATION</h4>
